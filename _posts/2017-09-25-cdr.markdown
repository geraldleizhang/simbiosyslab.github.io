## What is it?

Epidemics cause significant tolls financially and on the population. Influenza A  Effective outbreak containment and eradication requires quick detection. Traditional detection methods occupy weeks or require active participation by population members. By using mobile phones as behavioral sensors, a novel real-time outbreak detection method can exist. This method depends on two assumptions: population members actually alter activity while sick and mobile phone metadata collected passively can quantifiably capture this behavioral change. With the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Iceland as a use case, we use call-detailed records provided by Siminn, Iceland's largest mobile network operator, to observe that diagnosed individuals do indeed alter behavior. Furthermore, we aim to build a model that uses this behavior change to estimate the number of sick individuals in a population.

## Our Goals

A model that
- Estimates number of infected individuals in the population
- Runs in near real-time
- uses passively collected phone metadata
- is trained on clinical diagnosis, not self-diagnosis

Specifically, diagnosed individuals move less, talk longer, and make fewer phone calls in the few days around their diagnosis.



Throughout history humans have faced many epidemic outbreaks. Early detection and prevention of the spread can significantly reduce the damage a disease can inflict. Current methods of detection, which rely on doctors’ diagnosis of patients, have a significant lag where detection can take weeks. This lag reduces the effectiveness of any prevention of further spread. Our project proposes a new method of outbreak detection which relies on analysis of cellphone metadata. The new method looks at behavioral changes in the metadata for a population to predict the outbreak of a disease.  

The data is from the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 in Iceland, where we have two datasets one containing cellphone metadata and the other dates of diagnosis. Anonymity is preserved through randomly generated user IDs which are used to map between the two datasets.

    For each day we rank the value to the previous 10 values for the same weekday. The ranking ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 represents the lowest value and 1 the highest. Also, a ranking of 0.5 means that the value should fall in the middle of the 10 values, when ordered.

    The x-axis shows the relative days around date of diagnosis (DoD) where 0 is DoD. The y-axis shows the mean ranking for all users. The blue line represents infected users and the orange line represents all those who were not infected.
