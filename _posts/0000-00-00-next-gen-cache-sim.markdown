Cache is a major component in the memory hierarchy, which bridges the gap between fast computing devices and slow storage devices. A considerable amount of effort has been devoted to improving cache performance. However, due to high computation overhead, research in the past overlooked the time dimension of cache and focused more on the static modeling and analysis of cache. In fact, we noticed that cache behavior varies with time, and we can see phase change and diurnal patterns in the storage traces and CDN cache traces. One example figure is below:

<div class="ui segments">
  <div class="ui segment">
    <img class="ui centered large rounded image" src="../resources/posts/cache_time/w92_vscsi1.vscsitrace_heatmap_LRU_800000_r.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="ui secondary segment">
    This is a heat map of a seven-day storage cache trace. The color of a pixel at (x, y) in the plot shows the hit ratio if we start cache at time x and end at time y. This figure clearly shows that there are phase changes in cache behavior and self-repeating behavior from day to day.
  </div>
</div>
This phenomenon is not unique to this single trace; we have observed this in most of our 100 storage and CDN traces. Moreover, we believe similar pattern widely exists in most caches and should be exploited for improving cache performance.

So in this project, we aims to exploit the similarity in cache behavior and make cache smarter.
