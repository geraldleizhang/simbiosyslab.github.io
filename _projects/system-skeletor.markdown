All storage systems exist to serve some group of users and applications. Tuning
a storage system is a delicate balance between reliability, availability,
security, performance spread over the users, or workloads, that the system
serves. For cloud storage, elasticity is a crucial factor, but misconfiguration
in reactive storage tuning has been cited to be a leading cause of production
failures. The Skeletor project, focused on transferring and transforming provisioning insights to match dynamic
workloads, is breaking ground for system improvements spanning from the power
footprint to cache management to selecting an appropriate reliability
configuration.
